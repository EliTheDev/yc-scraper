# yc-scraper
JS script to scrape companies on current page -> CSV.

I built it in order to import a bunch of hiring YC companies into one big Notion CRM.

## Usage
1. Go to YC companies list
2. Filter to the companies you're looking for in the sidebar
3. Run script in console
4. Choose place to save .csv
